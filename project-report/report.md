The classification of potential loan defaulters is one of the tough and important solutions in the bank sector today. Especially, when there is little or no data regarding the customers\' credit history.


In 2018, Home Credit , an international non-bank, consumer finance group released a variety of data to urge the data enthusiasts all over the world to come up with new models and predictions. If a optimal solution is achieved, it would help understand the clients potential of repaying the loan.

We\’ll be working on different modelling techniques like k means, logistic regression, naive Bayes and random forests to get provide our solution. [@www-kagglehomecredit]


### Questions

* what is the best evaluation metric for the models and it’s precision, recall or specificity and
sensitivity.
* Which is the best model to predict the defaulters.
* Which features influence most to the default payments.
* How this can help to minimize bank’s risk.
* We will analyze data to answer more questions.

### Timeline

* Data Pre-processing – we will be using python for this
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data modelling
  * k-means
  * Logistic Regression
  * Naive Bayes
  * Random Forest
* Modelling Analysis
* Evaluation and Conclusion
