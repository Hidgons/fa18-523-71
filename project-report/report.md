## Abstract

The classification of potential loan defaulters is one of the tough and important solutions in the bank sector today. Especially, when there is little or no data regarding the customers\' credit history.In 2018, Home Credit , an international non-bank, consumer finance group released a variety of data to urge the data enthusiasts all over the world to come up with new models and predictions. If an optimal solution is achieved, it would help understand the clients potential of repaying the loan.To classify the defaulters we have tried various approaches including PCA and Random Forests for feature selection and Random Forest, k-nn and XGBOOST for modelling with XGBOOST giving us the best results. To build the models, Jupyter Notebook IDE with a python 3.7 kernel was used on the  cloud computing service Microsoft Azure. [@www-kagglehomecredit]
