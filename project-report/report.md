## Abstract

Classifying potential loan defaulters from clients is one of the most important probelms in banking sector today. Especially, when there is little or no data regarding the customers\' credit history, it's difficult to classify.In 2018, Home Credit , an international non-bank, consumer finance group released a variety of data in a kaggle competetion to urge the datascience enthusiasts all over the world to come up with new models and predictions. If an optimal solution is achieved, it would help us understand the clients potential of repaying the loan and also help many potential clients get their loans sanctioned .To classify the defaulters, we have tried various approaches including PCA and Random Forests for feature selection and Random Forest, k-nn and XGBOOST for modelling with XGBOOST giving us the best results. To build the models, Jupyter Notebook IDE with a python 3.7 kernel was used on the cloud computing service Microsoft Azure. [@www-kagglehomecredit]
