### Abstract:

IOT is one of the most evovlving technologies out there today and it's all about ubiquitous computing. Almost all the industries today are using sennsors to diagnose the performance of their systems, this data is being used to understand the maintenance, repair issues of machines and also in bettering the output produced by them. With the humungous growth of such systems not only in factories and machinery but also in daily walks of life, the data generated is growing exponentially. With such huge data handling, Big data infrastructure plays a pivotal role in running and functioning of IoT.
